<h2>Numpy and Pandas</h2>
<p>NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, 
adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
The ancestor of NumPy, Numeric, was originally created by Jim Hugunin with contributions from several other developers. 
In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy by incorporating features of the competing Numarray into Numeric, with extensive modifications. 
NumPy is open-source software and has many contributors.

<h2>Data visualization</h2>
<p>Data visualization is the graphic representation of data. It involves producing images that communicate relationships among the represented data to viewers of the images. This communication is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. This mapping establishes how data values will be represented visually, determining how and to what extent a property of a graphic mark, such as size or color, will change to reflect changes in the value of a datum.
